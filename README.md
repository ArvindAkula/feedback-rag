# Review Insights Q&A üìÑüí°

This project is a Streamlit web application that allows users to ask questions about a dataset of customer reviews and receive AI-generated answers based on the most relevant review excerpts. It leverages Sentence Transformers for semantic search and OpenAI's GPT models for answer generation, implementing a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.

## üåü Features

* **Interactive Q&A Interface:** Ask natural language questions about customer reviews.
* **AI-Powered Answers:** Get answers generated by an OpenAI GPT model (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo).
* **Contextual Evidence:** View the specific review excerpts used by the AI to formulate the answer.
* **Efficient Semantic Search:** Uses `SentenceTransformer` models to find the most relevant review chunks quickly.
* **Caching:** Utilizes Streamlit's caching mechanisms (`@st.cache_resource`, `@st.cache_data`) for faster loading of models and data on subsequent runs.
* **Easy Configuration:** Model names and file paths can be adjusted in the script.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it Works (Technology & Workflow)

The application follows a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern:

1.  **Data Loading & Preprocessing:**
    * Customer reviews are loaded from a CSV file (`data/reviews.csv`).
    * The review text is cleaned and split into smaller, manageable chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` from Langchain.

2.  **Embedding Generation (Knowledge Base):**
    * A `SentenceTransformer` model (default: `"all-MiniLM-L6-v2"`) is loaded.
    * This model generates dense vector embeddings for all review text chunks. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text.

3.  **User Query & Retrieval:**
    * The user enters a question via the Streamlit interface.
    * The user's question is also embedded using the same `SentenceTransformer` model.
    * **Cosine similarity** is calculated between the user's query embedding and all review chunk embeddings.
    * The top 'k' most semantically similar review chunks are retrieved as the "relevant context."

4.  **Augmentation & Generation:**
    * The retrieved relevant review chunks are combined with the user's original question to form a detailed prompt.
    * This augmented prompt is sent to an OpenAI model (default: `"gpt-4"`).
    * The OpenAI model generates an answer based *only* on the provided question and review excerpts.

5.  **Display:**
    * The AI-generated answer and the supporting review excerpts are displayed to the user.

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Python 3.8+
    * pip (Python package installer)

2.  **Clone the Repository (Example):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-name>
    ```

3.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
    ```txt
    streamlit
    pandas
    python-dotenv
    openai
    langchain
    sentence-transformers
    numpy
    scikit-learn
    ```
    Then install them:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Set up OpenAI API Key:**
    * Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.
    * Add your OpenAI API key to this file:
        ```env
        OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
        ```
    * Replace `"your_openai_api_key_here"` with your actual API key.
    * **Important:** Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent committing your API key.

6.  **Prepare Data:**
    * Ensure you have a CSV file containing your reviews.
    * By default, the application expects this file at `data/reviews.csv`. Create a `data` directory if it doesn't exist and place your `reviews.csv` file there.
    * The CSV file should have a column named `review_text` containing the actual review content.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

Once the setup is complete, run the Streamlit application from your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run your_script_name.py
